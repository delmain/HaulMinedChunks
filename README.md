# HaulMinedChunks

Will mark stone-chunks to be hauled when they spawn from mining.
I just got tired of random chunks laying about, slowing down my miners.
Should work on any chunk, vanilla and modded.
Safe to add/remove anytime

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
